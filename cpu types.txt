--------MINOR--------

	Minor is an in-order processor model with a fixed pipeline but configurable data structures and 
execute behaviour. It is intended to be used to model processors with strict in-order execution behaviour and
allows visualisation of an instruction’s position in the pipeline through the MinorTrace/minorview.py format/tool. 
The intention is to provide a framework for micro-architecturally correlating the model with a particular, 
chosen processor with similar capabilities.The model isn’t currently capable of multithreading but 
there are THREAD comments in key places where stage data needs to be arrayed to support multithreading.
